This system is intended to support vocabulary-learning activities.

As a learner, it is important to acquire a lot of vocabulary. However, in my journey of learning the words of a new language, I found that a lot of my time was dedicated on ineffective activities: open dictionnaries, check the possible forms (in a brain-unfriendly compact format), check for traductions, keep track of the words to search later.

Moreover, pen-and-paper-based learning leads to relatively ineffective learning effectiveness. The brain is good at making connections and reinforcement is important. But, in P&P mode, I end up with 20+ pages of lists of (loosely) related words that fell out of any context; many of these words being edge-cases that I never encountered more than once. As a pragmatic learner, I rather focus on things I can and do actually use; and have the opportunity of bringing them in context.
The pen and paper is also a bit inconvenient as a format, as it requires to have the actual pen and paper available. This requirement involves the growth of concurrent and unlearned stockpiles of new words I learn from different environments (e.g. work, home), while, at the same time, having imbalance treatment of these stockpiles (e.g. the work stockpile keeping to grow over time). I also wish to practice my hearing, which classic paper does not offer; and wish to practice it while not actively looking at the paper, like my morning workout routine.

As a consequence, I intend to make of a simple bot for helping me around with this. Discord seems to be a practical interface of choice, as it has some easy primitives to work with; I can simply have an agent running somewhere for generating vocabulary tips for me; and I can access this service from any browser (okay, I must confess, 50% of it is for the naming pun, as "ordförråd" means "vocabulary" in the Swedish language).

My very short term goal is to have a basic translator that feeds me with random words from a list on Discord.
As mid-term, I will go for convenience features, notably:

*a control-C control-V interface feeding my system with text I stumble upon

*some statistics for highlighting how many words I learned, what topics I know

*some optimization on what vocabulary to learn next, based on the words I hit the most frequently; on text I want to be able of going through; on text networks for learning paired words

*some convenience features, notably for being read the text and basic voice commands

As a matter of community service, I must say that my time is way too limited for developing tailored features. Though, if you see a use for you in my software and/or if you have constructive comments, I will be happy to hear about them and maybe help. Possibly at some point I may develop a tutorial or a multi-user version. If you want to make some extension, you are welcome to contribute, but be ready to operate independently.

The software is focused for Swedish at the moment, though the architecture is (in principle) expandable on to any language. I wish to thank the Swedish government for the very good "Swedish for Immigrants" program it offers. By providing me the opportunity for effective learning of Swedish and promoting self-reflection over one's learning, I can today step up and try to make things better, for me and, hopefully, future learners.
